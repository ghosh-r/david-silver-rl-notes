### About

Even though newer sources exist, the lecture series by David Silver remains the most common place to start one's journey in Reinforcement Learning. The lectures are crisp, succinct, pedagogically superb. The lectures are dense, and requires repeated viewing and undivided attention. I took this lecture notes while studying Reinforcement Learning from these lectures, and I feel that it might be helpful to others.

These notes are written using [Notion](https://www.notion.so). I have exported the notes into PDF format for offline viewing. However, I suggest that you follow the Notion version as it is more up to date.

NOTE: I highly recommend to read these notes along with the lectures and slides. Reading these notes in a standalone manner is not recommended.
